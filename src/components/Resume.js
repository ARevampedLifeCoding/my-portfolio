        <p>
          An upcoming graduate of the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp, I'm
          excited to re- enter the workforce as a software engineer. Learning to
          code has been the hardest yet most rewarding skill I have ever
          studied. The continual cycle of growth required for this industry
          excites the learner in me. This trait has made me a professional who
          is eager and ready to transition from my previous roles.
